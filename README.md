# GitHub Fix UI

Latest changes rolled out by GitHub team contained some quirks that were just hurtful to my eyes. This small repository contains a Chrome extension that applies small CSS fixes to make their changes bearable.

There is no **big** changes done here. You can see below how GitHub page looks like with my fixes applied:

What is fixed:

- Less rounded buttons, tags and labels
- Fixed **terrible** green color of primary buttons
- Other buttons look like buttons, not like tags
- Page head is now slightly grayish
